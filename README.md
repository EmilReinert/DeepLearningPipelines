# DeepLearningPipelines

This is an experimental Repository in cooperation with a 'Deep Learning for Code Generation' project, that tries to consist of referenced and self-constructed Code Generation Tasks, written in Python3.


## Structure

The different tasks can be found as whole in 'pipelines'
and separated into its core-processes in 'modules'


## Tasks include:

- **Defect Prediction with Deep-Tree LSTM:**
	An Implementation attempt to 'A deep tree-based model for software defect prediction'
	-> https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00921

- **Prediction of semantic relatedness of two sentence &**
- **Sentiment Classification with Tree-Structured LSTM:**
	Python Adaptation and Module Extraction of
	'Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks'
	-> https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00075
	An already public implementation can be found here: https://github.com/stanfordnlp/treelstm
